#ishyChat
A very basic chat client/server implementation written in Python and using Twisted for the connection.
##Features
* It works (well, this is a very early ALPHA version).
* It has a cool name.
* It is minimalistic.
* It has some undocumented syntax which allows previous messages to be quickly brought up in the entrybox (read the code to understand this).
##TODO
* Fix glitches and whatnot.
* Add command-line options.
* Sort out name conflicts.
* Add bold and colour text to make things look nicer.
* Add hyperlink support (using the webbrowser module).
Feel free to do any of these for me.
